### Features
- Async http request user axios.
- Randomised transitions, fonts and quotes.

### Possible expansions
This is a pretty small app, so there isn't a whole heap that can be added.
but here's a few ideas I may come back to when I have nothing better to do.

- More transitions.
- Adjust font-sizes for each font to get them all approximately the same size.
- Add some css media queeries to make more responsive.

### About
The following project is from the curriculum of [https://www.freecodecamp.org/]
- User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".
- User Story #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".
- User Story #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".
- User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".
- User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".
- User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".
- User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
- User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.
- User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
- User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.
